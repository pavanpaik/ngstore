  <h3>Energy efficiency</h3>
  Unlike conventional extractor fans which wastefully extract expensively produced heat, 
  Heat Recovery Ventilators recover exhaust heat. The world is becoming increasingly aware 
  of the enormous cost of energy production, and this, plus the use of fossil fuels to 
  generate power, is a significant environmental consideration. Extractor fans potentially 
  waste over a million kilowatts of energy every year. This is comparable to the total output 
  of two large power stations. Replacing conventional extractor fans with heat recovery systems 
  could save at least half of that energy loss.
