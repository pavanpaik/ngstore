    Sick building syndrome (SBS) describes a situation whereby people experience symptoms of ill health that seem to be linked to spending time in a building, but where no specific cause can be identified.

  <div class='article'>
    <p>
    The term building-related illness (BRI) refers to recognised diseases, often infections, e.g. Legionnaires' disease, caused by being in a building. The cause of sick building syndrome is thought to be at least in part due to changes in building and ventilation design triggered by the energy crisis in the 1970s.
    </p>
    <p>
    One large recent study found no significant relation between most aspects of the physical work environment and symptom prevalence.<sup>1</sup>
    </p>

    <p>
    <ul>
    <li>Greater effects were found with features of the psychosocial work environment including high job demands and low support.</li>
    <li>The report concluded that the physical environment of office buildings appears to be less important than features of the psychosocial work environment in explaining differences in the prevalence of symptoms.</li>
    </ul>
    However, sick building syndrome usually occurs in those employed in buildings containing many people who are working closely together, especially in new buildings with sealed windows.
    </p>
    <h3>Risk factors</h3>
    <p>
    Sick building syndrome (SBS) is related to both personal and environmental risk factors.<sup>2</sup> Risk factors for sick building syndrome include:
    <ul>
    <li>Poor ventilation.</li>
    <li>Air conditioning.</li>
    <li>Low humidity.</li>
    <li>Psychological factors such as stress or poor staff morale.</li></ul></p>
    <h3>Causes</h3>
    <p>
    <ul>
    <li>Internal chemical contaminants: usually air pollutants.</li>
    <ul>
    <li>Initial emissions from components and fittings of a building - the 'new smell' generally dissipates over a short period, but can last years.</li>
    <li>Volatile organic compounds, including formaldehyde, cleaning products, manufactured plastic and wood products.</li>
    <li>Ozone from photocopiers and printers.</li>
    <li>Carbon monoxide, carbon dioxide<sup>3</sup> and other inorganic oxides given off as combustion products in heating systems.</li>
    <li>Small fibres from furnishings, regularly agitated into the air by frequent sweeping. Also, asbestos in older buildings.</li>
    <li>Tobacco smoke.</li>
    </ul></li>
    <li>External contaminants: outside air entering a building.</li>
    <ul>
    <li>Vehicle exhaust fumes: from streets/underground car parks.</li>
    <li>Recycling of the building's own exhaust back in through poorly positioned vents/windows.</li>
    <li>Other external air pollution or airborne particles, e.g. pollen, moulds.<sup>4</sup></li>
    <li>The prime suspect in most cases is inadequate ventilation. The factors leading to poor ventilation include insufficient outside air, poor filtration of internal and external air, contaminated duct-work, dirty heating, ventilating and air conditioning units, poor planning and placement of vents.</li></ul>
    </li>
    </ul>
    </p>
    <h3>Presentation</h3>
    <p>
    General tiredness is often the most common symptom. It usually starts within a few hours of arriving at work, and improves within minutes of leaving the building. Symptoms may be worse in the winter months in northern climates.<sup>5</sup>
    <ul>
    <li>Headaches and dizziness; headaches are usually non-migrainous, rarely throbbing, usually described as dull, and often as a pressure on the head.<sup>5</sup></li>
    <li>Tiredness, loss of concentration.</li>
    <li>Eye problems.</li>
    <li>Skin problems, e.g. dry or itchy skin.</li>
    <li>Nausea.</li>
    <li>Coughing, shortness of breath, wheezing.</li>
    <li>Ear, nose or throat irritation.<sup>6</sup></li>
    </ul>
    </p>
    <h3>Workplace assessment</h3>
    <p>
    Guidance from the Health and Safety Executive (HSE) recommends that employers should:
    <ul>
    <li>Carry out an employee survey to see if the occurrence of symptoms is higher than expected.</li>
    <li>Check the general cleanliness of the building, the state of all cleaning machinery, e.g. vacuum cleaners, and the usage and storage of cleaning materials.</li>
    <li>Check the heating, ventilation and air conditioning system.</li>
    <li>After any initial steps to resolve the problem have been implemented, it may be necessary to repeat the employee survey and it may be necessary to carry out a more detailed assessment of the workplace environment.</li>
    </ul>
    </p>
    <h3>Treating the underlying problem</h3>
    <p>
    <ul><li>Education and recognition of the problem.</li>
    <li>Addressing relevant psychosocial issues, e.g. high job demands and low support.</li>
    <li>Removal of the pollution source if possible.</li>
    <li>Improved planning of building ventilation.</li>
    <li>Maintenance of indoor air quality by regular servicing and quality measurements.</li>
    <li>Discouragement of smoking.</li>
    <li>Increasing the number of live plants in buildings.</li>
    </ul>
