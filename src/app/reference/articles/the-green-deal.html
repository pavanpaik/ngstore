    <p>Increasing insulation often requires a
    re-balancing of ventilation. Which?
    Magazineâ€™s damp expert David Prince
    (founder of dampexpert.com) considers
    Ultrovent passive ventilation units as one
    possible solution.</p>

Condensation already affects a large
number of properties due to an increase
in water production brought about by
modern lifestyles. At the same time,
doors and windows are draught proofed
and chimney flues sealed. The result is
often unhealthy mould growth affecting
cold surfaces and poorly ventilated areas.
Ultrovents are designed to ventilate
living rooms and bedrooms where the
constant trickle ventilation provides up
to 2.8 litres of water vapour to escape
over a 24 hour period. A single air brick
Ultrovent is usually sufficient to ventilate
a room with a floor area of 20m<sup>2</sup>. Core
drill options are also available with
an output of 1.2 litres.</p>

<p>
At the heart of the Ultrovent
filter is a thermal core that
discourages cold draughts and
promotes the removal of damp air
in a controlled way. The filter also
reduces heat loss and through-the vent
noise. The air brick cavity
liner is constructed from high
impact polystyrene to reduce cold
bridging and provide increased
strength and resistance to
distortion.</p>

<p>
The Ultrovent air brick unit can
also be installed into existing air brick
openings making it an easy upgrade
option. By retaining the existing
external air brick, installation can be
completed from inside the property
making it ideal for high rise properties.
Damp Expert will be launching a
number of new products in the New
Year and is seeking to increase the
number of distributors. If you are
interested in becoming a distributor
then contact Susie Toms at
<a href='mailto:susie@dampexpert.com'>susie@dampexpert.com</a>.</p>
<p>Ultrovents have been independently
tested at the Wolfson M.T.I.A. Unit at
Southampton University. Ultrovents are
not suitable for providing ventilation to
heating appliances.</p>
