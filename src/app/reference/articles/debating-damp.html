      Is a Heat Recovery Ventilation unit the answer to condensation problems, or should you just open a window? David Prince damp expert at Which? magazine talks to customer Sue Wheat.

    <p><strong>Sue:</strong> We’ve had a terrible problem with condensation in our house – is it a common problem with properties these days?</p>

    <p><strong>David:</strong> When I get a call out to visit a property I can usually tell which one it is before I even check the door number as I can see the water streaming down the windows. The way we live now, with lots of washing being dried in the house, everyone having a shower everyday, lots of cooking and people not opening their windows so much for security reasons – it makes sense that the moisture from all that activity has to go somewhere. And as windows are double glazed and people’s houses are more sealed up, the moisture stays inside and condenses on the walls and windows. So if your property has poor ventilation it will be prone to condensation – and you’ll know about it from mould on the walls and the streaming windows in winter.</p>

    <p><strong>Sue:</strong> It seemed to be a particular problem for us after we moved into our Victorian terrace, which is very cold – would that be right?</p>

    <p><strong>David:</strong> Water in the air condenses on a cold surface and if the walls are cold because they are solid brick construction houses without the chance of cavity wall insulation then this makes it worse. </p>

    <p><strong>Sue:</strong> So should people ventilate the house or insulate the walls?</p>

    <p><strong>David:</strong> Ventilation is cheaper, but insulation of the walls will help control condensation although it doesn’t always completely solve the problem. The moisture has to get out of the house somehow, so you have to ventilate.</p>

    <p><strong>Sue:</strong> Why doesn’t opening a window or putting a ventilation brick in work? We did that in our son’s room but the mould was still terrible. In the bathroom and kitchen we opened the windows after showering or cooking but mould was still a problem.</p>

    <p><strong>David:</strong> Of course, the natural thing to do when your kitchen or bathroom gets steamed up is to open a door or window but there isn’t the control element required to solve a condensation problem. Another serious downside is that all the warm air in the room goes out with the humidity and you have a cold room! The heat recovery ventilation unit not only takes the moisture out of the room but captures the heat and recycles it – up to 86 per cent of the heat can be recovered with a single room unit. This saves energy and reduces your fuel bills. </p>

    <p><strong>Sue:</strong> So how does heat recovery ventilation unit work?</p>

    <p><strong>David:</strong> The heat recovery ventilation unit extracts air from the room and replaces it with warmed fresh air. The unit operates in either trickle or boost mode to suit the conditions.  We suggest you set this to keep the relative humidity at about 55-60 per cent. Relative humidity means the moisture content of air relative to the amount of moisture the air can hold at a particular temperature. Mould can occur when the relative humidity exceeds 70 per cent.</p>

    <p><strong>Sue:</strong> So what types of heat recovery ventilation units are most popular?</p>

    <p><strong>David:</strong> We specialise in dealing with damp problems in older properties. The single room unit is therefore one of the most popular units we install but you wouldn’t typically see those in new houses as they have whole-house systems.</p>

    <p>We also install multi-room units starting at 3 rooms and going up to around 8 rooms. We often install these in the roof space to ventilate the upstairs rooms supported by single room units downstairs.</p>

    <p><strong>Sue:</strong> Isn’t that out of most people’s price range?</p>

    <p><strong>David:</strong> The single room units can be installed for well under a £1000 and multi-room units for less than £1500.  The cost of dealing with mouldy and damp walls is not insignificant not to mention replacing affected items of clothing. Paying the initial outlay to control humidity is a better option than continually fighting the battle with mould and damaged walls. </p>
