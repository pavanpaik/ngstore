    <h1>What is wet rot</h1>
  </header>
  <p>Wet rot is a fungal attack on damp or wet timber. Superficial growth may affect surrounding 
     masonry but damage is not usually caused to such material. Wet rot spores are present in the 
     air and require a moisture content of around 60% in the timber it attacks. Timbers most at 
     risk are those that have come into contact with water such as from a leaking roof and timbers 
     that are in a damp environment such as a sub floor area.<p>
  <p>Timbers affected by wet rot should be 
       replaced or repaired. Treatment may be possible if damage is not extensive. The conditions 
       which lead to a wet rot attack should be addressed and the drying out process encouraged.</p>
