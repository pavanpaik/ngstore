    <h1>What is penetrating damp</h1>
  </header>
  <p>Penetrating damp is generally taken to refer to water passing through the structure of a building from outside and 
    is associated with a building defect. Common causes include leaking guttering, running overflow pipes and porous brickwork. 
    Penetrating damp often creates dampness on internal surfaces that provides a strong clue as to the cause. Moss growth on external brickwork is also an indication of a potential penetrating damp problem.</p>
  <p>The term penetrating damp is also used more broadly to include internal defects such as plumbing leaks and dampness affecting earth-retaining walls.</p>
