    <h1>What is dry rot</h1>
  </header>
  <p>Dry rot (Serpula lacrymans) is a fungus that attacks timbers. In buildings such an attack can be devastating as structural damage often results. Once established, dry rot has the ability to grow through solid walls and behind plasterwork. It is good practice to remove all infected material rather than rely solely on chemical treatment.</p>
  <p>Dry rot spores are present in the air. Should the spores come into contact with timbers with a moisture content of around 23% there is a strong risk of an attack. Dry rot has four distinct elements, a combination of which may be present in any outbreak. The elements are: Mycelium, Hyphae (Strands), Sporophores (Fruiting body) and Spores.</p>

  <p>Dry rot treatment is highly specialised and expert advice should always be sought should an outbreak be suspected. Treatments are generally covered by long-term guarantees.</p>
