    <h1>What is rising damp</h1>
  </header>
  <p>Rising damp is a natural process affecting structures built in contact with the ground. 
     A damp proof course is included in the building structure to control rising damp. Dampness rises due to 
     capillary action, similar to the way oil rises up the wick of a lantern. 
     Rising damp primarily affects properties built before 1930 but can be found in almost any property.
  </p>
  
  <p>Damp proof courses fail for a variety of reasons but most commonly due to age or bridging actions that allow the damp proof course to be bypassed. Older properties may not have the benefit of a damp proof course at all.</p>

  <p>The height to which dampness will rise within a property is usually less than 1 metre, so it is generally a ground floor problem. There are various methods of installing a new damp proof course into an existing property, including chemical injection and electro osmosis. As dampness rises from the ground soluble nitrate and chloride salts accumulate in the wall structure and plasterwork. Effective damp proof course installation is generally accompanied by the replacement of contaminated plasterwork with salt resistant plaster.</p>
